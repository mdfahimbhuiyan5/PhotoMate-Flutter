# Project Initiation


# Title : PhotoMates IIUM.

PhotoMates IIUM is a recruiting app aims to bridge this gap by providing a dedicated platform to connect photographers and clients within IIUM. It offers a space where photographers can showcase their portfolios, highlight their expertise, and receive bookings, while clients can effortlessly browse and hire photographers based on their specific needs. By fostering a network of creativity and professionalism, this app seeks to enhance the campus experience, empower photographers, and simplify event planning for all stakeholders.


# Background Of The Problem

Photography is important for documenting memories, exhibiting creativity, and meeting both personal and academic demands. However, there isn't a specific platform that links photographers with people in need of their services, even though the International Islamic University Malaysia (IIUM) staff and students are becoming more and more in need of professional photographic services.

The IIUM community's talented photographers have fewer options to connect with potential clients, develop their portfolios, and display their abilities due to the lack of a centralised platform. This disparity emphasises the necessity of an approachable and user-friendly solution to close the gap between photographers and people looking to hire them.

In order to solve this issue and promote an established creative ecosystem inside the university, the suggested mobile application, PhotoMates IIUM, seeks to develop a smooth and effective platform that benefits both users and photographers.


# Objective

The objectives of PhotoMates IIUM include:

Facilitating Connections
Establish a centralised platform within the IIUM community that serves as a conduit between clients and photographers.

Promoting Local Talent
To give photographers from IIUM a place to display their work, get noticed, and expand their professional networks.


Streamlining the Process
Make it easier for users to find, evaluate, and reserve photographers based on their choices, including availability, price, and style.

Encouraging Creativity
Encourage photography as an art form and a career in order to cultivate a creative ecology within IIUM.

Enhancing Convenience
To offer a user-friendly and reliable platform that saves time and effort for both photographers and clients.
